# aura-reflect

a small python script that tries to recreate the asus aura's color mode that reflects screen color to connected aura devices

# why?
1. i dont want to install aura creator
2. the original effect on aura creator instantly changes the color to screen colors unlike this script that smoothly fades between colors
